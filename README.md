# Burger Queen

Thank you for visiting my repository. This project uses Node.js, Express, Handlebars, and MySQL, and the "Burger Queen" appliation. 

Here’s how it works:

    Burger Queen is a restaurant application that allows users to input the names of the burgers they would like to eat.
    	Enter the name of the burger in the text box.
    	Click the "Build It!" button to save the burger to the MySQL database.
    	The burger you built will be listed on the screen.
    	Click the "Devour" button to consume your burger!
    
This project is anyone who would like to play.

Enjoy!
